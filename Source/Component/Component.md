# Awperative Components

### Code and Documentation by Avery Norris

Components are the main change in Awperative's take on a modern, unbiased
**EC/ECS** [(Entity Component System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system), or GameObject Component system; traditionally, 
a GameObject Component system involves 2/3 types of data.

    Parent Scene/World :
        
        Children GameObjects/Actors :
            
            Children Components/Scripts


- **Scenes** are basically the worlds these objects inhabit. Common *synonyms* are Worlds or Levels. If GameObjects
  are files in our analogy, then scenes are separate hard drives. The scene's jobs mainly center around being a
  Docker. *(Rather than an object of functionality)*


- **GameObjects** are the parents components are glued to, in most Game Libraries and Engines
  they are also treated as physical objects; and often given properties like **Transform** and **Tags**.
  GameObjects can also commonly nest in each other. I sometimes find it useful to view
  these as Directories for components.

  
 - **Components** are what we actually care about, shockingly, they are the
"Component" in Entity Component System, and you can think about them as the actual
scripts or program in your Game, but a little more object-oriented.




\
**Keep in mind** that this is a general description of **other** Game Development Platforms. It's impossible to summarize
every single **ECS** in the world. (A lot of ECS' also use **systems** alongside this hierarchy)

## How Awperative Differs

As of this current version, Awperative's **ECS** has taken on a different form than most.

    Parent Scene/World

        Components :

            Children Components

One of the main **Awperative Principles** is **Generalization**; and during development it became clear
GameObjects are unnecessary, which lead to the Component partially taking over the job.

Rather than the traditional **ECS** Components (Such as Unity), Awperative's Components are actually closer to a combination of the **GameObjects** and **Components** we discussed earlier.

Awperative does not implement many fancy features out of the box. **Bias** is almost a requirement for GameObjects
to be useful. But in Awperative, where even position isn't implemented by default, GameObjects
tend to become basically useless objects; that just hold **Components** and transfer **Events**


Because of this I decided to make a more flexible type of entity that can act as GameObject and Component at once.
However, Components still do not implement many features out of the box, instead we use their **expandability** to our advantage.
(Which will be explained later)

## How To Use

### Events

Components are rather easy to control, similar to Engines like Unity, you can make your own custom script by inheriting the abstract "**Component**" class.

    public class MyScript : Component {}

On the surface level, Components provide you with your current scene and parents.

They also give very handy Game Events which are present in 99% of Game Development Platforms.

    Load
    Unload

    Update
    Draw

    Create
    Remove


 - Load and Unload provides a call when the Game is opened and closed respectively, please be wary: these will not call under a force close.


 - Update and Draw both trigger each frame, starting with Update then Draw, like most frameworks. It is recommended to put your drawing code
 within Draw() and keep almost everything else inside Update()


 - Finally Create and Remove are called when the Component is spawned In/Out. It should be noted that Create is called **after** the constructor.
 If you try to make certain references or calls in the constructor it may not fully work, as the object is half instantiated. It is recommended to use Create when possible. Also, Destroy will not be called if the program is closed, just Unload.

You can call these events by adding them to your **Component-Inheriting-Class** as shown below. And **Awperative** will automatically
recognize it as an event! ([If you want to see under the hood](../Overhead/Reflection/EventManager.md))

    public void Update() {}
   
Putting this code inside any Component inheriting class, will create a method that gets called every single frame, just like that!

### Important Information

There are a few random tidbits that also make Awperative angry:

 - Components cannot have constructor Parameters, while **Empty** constructors do work, It's recommended to just use Create()


 - Some properties of the Component are calculated and NOT stored as one would expect. For instance: Scenes are not
    actually stored in the class, and they are calculated each time you use them. This is very inexpensive, but you should keep it in mind while developing.


 - There are many informative attributes tied to members of **Component**; I would recommend you look at them before using any tool inside Component. For instance: there are marking attributes such as CalculatedProperty that inform
   you of a member that is not stored but calculated each time you use it.


- A good chunk of the Component's functionality is actually coming from the Docker! If you cannot find the Documentation for something, it is probably actually a Docker related object.

## Examples and Good Practice

Since **Awperative** Components are slightly different compared to other ECSs; I thought it would be fitting to
create a few examples of good practice or "tactics" you can do.

First let's see how we can recreate typical GameObject behavior; I would most recommend using **Nested Components** to achieve this.
If we pretend we have implemented a few modules for basic transform profiles and sprite management, then we can easily make a basic movable sprite object.
Like so :

    Parent Scene/World
        
        Empty Component :

            Transform Component

            Sprite Component

We can expand upon this easily as well. Say we want to make it into a moveable player character, we can modify the Empty Component to
carry some additional functionality.

    Parent Scene/World
        
        Player Controller Component : <--

            Transform Component

            Sprite Component

If we want to give it a hitbox.

    Parent Scene/World
        
        Player Controller Component :

            Transform Component

            Sprite Component

            Hitbox Component <--

And maybe let's say we want to scale or offset that

    Parent Scene/World
        
        Player Controller Component :

            Transform Component

            Sprite Component

            Hitbox Component

                Transform Component <--

Of course, there is some additional programming that would be needed between each step.
**(Ex. Hitboxes listening to the child transform)**, but you can see how this data structure
builds intuitively. 

It can be handy to compartmentalize any repeating pieces of code or types into a **Component**. It is also
not immediately obvious at first, But I would say one of the largest utilities from an **object free component** system is the ability
to function at a high level in the scene.

Often times in component-object **ECS**'  you will have a **singleton** object/s that stores important one off Components, such as the *Camera*,
or the *Game's Asset Loader*. By virtue of GameObjects, these **singletons** are required to have at least an empty GameObject as a parent. I've always found this to be unsatisfying. Luckily, Awperative Components can operate as standalone objects!
You can insert a standalone Camera Component into the scene. Which feels cleaner and makes much more logical sense.

    Parent Scene/World
        
        Camera

        Asset Loader

## Under the Hood

As you've seen part of what makes **Components** so great is the fact that they can nest within themselves infinitely.
This is possible because of an essential piece known as the **Docker**.

Dockers are seen everywhere in Awperative. They are built to store   child Components. The Component class carries a Docker like so.

    Component : ComponentDocker

Dockers also provide the Add, Get and Destroy functions we all know and love, along with the list of child Components. 
It is also responsible for Awperative Events being passed through the Scene, for Example, an Update call would look like this

    Scene    -> Docker                       -> Component(Docker's child)
    Update() -> ChainEvent(EventType.Update) -> Update()


For anyone wondering why **ComponentDocker** is not a part of Component, or any other details: Please see ([ComponentDocker.md](../ComponentDocker/ComponentDocker.md))

## Specialized Components

Because of its focus on **Expandability**, Awperative also allows **third-party** Components to enter the Scene.
This allows for specialized Component or streamlined development, if you are willing to make assumptions.

Let's imagine you are making an enemy for an RPG and your Component Layout looks somewhat like this

    Parent Scene/World
        
        Enemy Pathfinding Component :

            Transform Component

            Sprite Component

            Hitbox Component

            Health Component

            UNIQUE Component

In this diagram, **UNIQUE Component** is just a placeholder for any future or enemy specific Components, and it is critical to our example.
And let's imagine that any time you add an enemy, then you will probably be adding some sort of "UNIQUE Component" there; And this unique Component often
uses aspects from the others present.

In a scenario like this, it would likely behoove you to create a specialized Component type. As mentioned earlier, Components are identified by inheriting the
abstract Component class. But it is possible to build an in-between class for additional functionality.

 - Traditional Pattern

    
    Your Script : Component : Docker

 - Example Specialized Pattern


    Your Script : EnemyComponent : Component : Docker

As you can see we inherited through a new (Theoretical) class called EnemyComponent rather than Component. This is perfectly legal; and intended!
You can do virtually anything in your specialized Component in-between. I most recommend making use of **lambda** in situations like this.

For instance, you can provide simpler access to another Component like so

    int Health -> Parent.Get<Health>().Health;

Any future EnemyComponents can simply put "**Health**" and it will correctly retrieve the dynamic value.

I should mention that this power comes with **great responsibility**. In this case: using EnemyComponent without a Health Component
will cause logged errors, and possibly a runtime error/halt. But this functionality poses to harm to anyone using **Components** as normal.
